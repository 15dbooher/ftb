# Fraction To Binary Converter (ftb)

## by Daniel Booher

This is a python script that converts a fraction or non-fraction **Decimal Number (base 10)** to the equivalent **Binary Number (base 2)**.

Currently it cannot convert from binary to decimal.

If you'd like to add this feature, please feel free to do so

# Usage

`python ftb.py <fraction> <number of decimals>`

> `fraction` is the base-10 number that you would like to conver to binary (Note: if it's a fraction it must be in **decimal** form!)
> `number of decimals` is the number of decimals (degree of accuracy) placed after the whole number part of the output binary number

# Example

> Input: `python ftb.py 123.456 3`
> Output: `1111011.011`
